      <p>My name is Michael Dubois and I am currently enrolled in a UNC bootcamp to become a full-stack
        developer. I was raised in North Carolina, and upon graduating high school, joined the 
        United States Air Force as a Network Intelligence Analyst. I was Active Duty for six years, 
        the entirety of which was at Lackland, AFB in San Antonio, Texas. Afterwards, I worked as a U.S. Army
        Contractor for 2 years in the same career field.</p>

      <p>My career with the military solidified my interest in computing, development, and engineering and helped jumpstart
        my skillbase. I was afforded a lot of opportunities, which granted me a basic knowledge of R, Python, and CCENT.  
        When not nerding out, I enjoy cooking and spending time with my two dogs, Ruger and Karma.</p>
