                   My name is Michael Dubois and I am currently enrolled in a UNC bootcamp to become a full-stack
                   developer. I was raised in North Carolina, and upon graduating high school, joined the 
                   United States Air Force as a Network Intelligence Analyst. I was Active Duty for six years, 
                   the entirety of which was at Lackland, AFB in San Antonio, Texas. Afterwards, I worked as a U.S. Army
                   Contractor for 2 years in the same career field.

               <p class="bio">
                   My career with the military solidified my interest in computing, development, and engineering and helped jumpstart
                   my skillbase. I was afforded a lot of opportunities, which granted me a basic knowledge of R, Python, and CCENT.  
                   When not nerding out, I enjoy cooking and spending time with my two dogs, Ruger and Karma.
